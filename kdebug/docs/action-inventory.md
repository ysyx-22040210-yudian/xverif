# kdebug Action Inventory

本文件冻结当前 `kdebug.v1` public action 清单，供 ActionSpec、schema、
example 和 contract test 迁移使用。状态定义：

| status | 含义 |
| --- | --- |
| `stable` | 已实现，默认可给 agent 使用，contract drift 必须被测试挡住 |
| `experimental` | 已实现但字段或行为仍可能调整，agent 不应默认优先使用 |
| `deprecated` | 仍可能存在兼容路径，但不建议新流程使用 |
| `removed` | 已移除或明确不支持，仅保留迁移说明 |

资源需求定义：

| resource | 含义 |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | 不需要 `target` 资源 |
| `design` | 需要 `target.daidir` 或包含 design 的 `session_id` |
| `waveform` | 需要 `target.fsdb` 或包含 waveform 的 `session_id` |
| `combined` | 需要 `target.daidir` + `target.fsdb`，或包含两者的 session |
| `session` | 主要操作 top-level session registry |
| `any` | `target.daidir`、`target.fsdb` 或两者至少一个 |
